# Security Policies

## VULNERABILITIES

> Many projects here in beta could be vulnerable but, they would *'not likely'* to cause serious > problems like damaging your pc or causing other problems. I am talking about problems like glitches in the program.

## Supported Versions

> Check the info.md in the project folder to see supported versions per program / system.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

> Reporting bugs are highly thanked. Report issues in the issues section on Actions w/the project name (the folder name)! *The projects might be buggy or might be vulnerable to things.* they are betas and all-in-test unless i put **"COMPLETED"** in the **INFO.md** in the folder.
